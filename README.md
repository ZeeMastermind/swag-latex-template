Template in LaTeX for SWAG content

# How to Use

You will need to either get a Latex editor or use an online one like Overleaf (free if you're a student). If you use an online editor, SAVE YOUR TEXT SOMEWHERE ELSE FIRST! It can be a google doc, a back of a napkin, whatever. I use TeXStudio, but it doesn't really matter as long as it can compile LaTeX as LuaLaTex.

Then, download the swag_template.tex file and the images folder. You will also have to find SWAG_logo.png from DTRPG or Pinnacle's website and place it in the folder.

Then, open up the swag_template file in your LaTeX editor. Make sure you are compiling using LuaLaTex (TeXStudio defaults to PDFLaTeX) and compile this to test your setup.

Finally, you can start switching out the Lorem Ipsum text and headers with your own content.
